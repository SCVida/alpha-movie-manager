# alpha-movie-manager

Welcome to the Movie Manager project!
This is a beginner‑friendly website where our team will build pages for:
- Listing movies
- Showing showtimes
- Managing movie information
- Learning how to work together using GitHub and Codespaces

This repository is currently a starting point. We will add files and features as we go.


Project Structure
These are the files we will eventually create:

Code
index.html        → Homepage
movies.html       → List of movies
showtimes.html    → Showtimes page
style.css         → Website styling
app.js            → Website functionality
data.json         → Movie + showtime data 

Primary Programming Language
We are building this project using HTML5 as our primary programming language.

- It is the standard language for creating web pages
- Beginner‑friendly and easy for the whole team to learn
- Works smoothly with CSS (styling) and JavaScript (functionality)
- Runs in any browser with no installation required
- As the project grows, we may also use CSS and JavaScript, but HTML5 is our core language for structure and content.

Team Workflow
Everyone works in their own Codespace

All changes are saved to this GitHub repository

We will add features one at a time

We will document setup steps as we go

Goal for This Sprint
Make sure every team member can:
- Open the project in a Codespace
- Run and edit files
- Understand the basic structure
- Commit and push changes

Once everyone can do that, we’ll start building the actual movie manager website.
