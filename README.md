# alpha-movie-manager

Welcome to the Movie Manager project!
This is a beginner‑friendly website where our team will build pages for:
- Listing movies
- Showing showtimes
- Managing movie information
- Learning how to work together using GitHub and Codespaces

This repository is currently a starting point. We will add files and features as we go.


Project Structure
These are the files we will eventually create:

Code
index.html        → Homepage
movies.html       → List of movies
showtimes.html    → Showtimes page
style.css         → Website styling
app.js            → Website functionality
data.json         → Movie + showtime data 


Team Workflow
Everyone works in their own Codespace

All changes are saved to this GitHub repository

We will add features one at a time

We will document setup steps as we go

Goal for This Sprint
Make sure every team member can:
- Open the project in a Codespace
- Run and edit files
- Understand the basic structure
- Commit and push changes

Once everyone can do that, we’ll start building the actual movie manager website.
